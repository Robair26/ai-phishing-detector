Hey there,

It’s been a while — hope all is well! I wanted to reach out personally because we’ve got something exciting in the works and I immediately thought of you.

This is a limited invite-only initiative we’re kicking off, and we’re looking for people who are already making waves in the AI and cybersecurity space. I’d love to get your thoughts and possibly have you on board — it’s nothing formal, just a quick sync this week.

No pressure at all, but spots are filling fast. Let me know if you’re available to hop on for 10 minutes and I’ll send over the details.

Talk soon,  
Jenna

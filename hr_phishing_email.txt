Subject: HR Policy Update – Immediate Action Required

Hi Mike,

I hope you’ve been settling into the new quarter smoothly. We’ve made a few adjustments to the company’s benefits and payroll structure, and we’d love to hear your thoughts.

Just take a minute to review the summary and let us know if anything needs clarification. It’s a quick form — no need to worry.

Thanks for always being proactive. We’re counting on you to get this in by today.

Talk soon,  
Janet  
HR Coordinator
